| conditions | ?list[[Condition](#condition)] | An optional list of conditions required for the step to run |

### Condition

A condition is a function that must be true for a step to run.

```yml
op: eq | ne | gt | lt | ge | le
var: str
value: str
```

| Field | Type                       | Description                            |

| value | str                        | The value to compare to                |

### OpType

List of operation types:

| Name | Operation              |

### Action

An action defined a single action within a step. This is the base of all steps, for example replacing a string with a different given string.

#### Replace action

Replace actions are used to replace a specific string in a file. The `src` field specifies the string that should be replaced in the file, and the `dest` field specifices the string to replace it with. The `dest` field is formatted with defined variables.

A list of files can be provided, and each file will have the same transform applied to them.

```yml
- action: replace
  files: [str]
  src: str
  dest: str
```

#### Delete action

Delete actions are used to delete files.

```yml
- action: delete
  files: [str]
```

#### Create action

Create actions are used to create files. The `file` field specifies the file to be created, and the `content` field specifics the content to be placed into the file. The `content` field is formatted with defined variables.

```yml
- action: create
  file: str
  content: ?str
```

#### Rename action

Rename actions are used to rename files. The `file` field specifies the file to be renamed, and the `dest` field specifies the new name of the file. The `dest` field is formatted with defined variables.

```yml
- action: rename
  file: str
  dest: str
```

### Variables

Variables are defined in the `read` section of the noofile. All variables set in the `read` section will be available in the `steps` section.

Variables are used in the format `$${scope}:{name}`, for example `$$noo:year` or `$$var:author`. Variables with the `noo` scope are built into noo and will always be available. Variables with the `var` scope are defined in the `read` section.

The variables defined by noo are:

- `noo:year` - The current year
- `noo:month` - The current month
- `noo:day` - The current day
- `noo:hour` - The current hour
- `noo:minute` - The current minute
- `noo:second` - The current second
- `noo:name` - The name of the project
