These noofiles can be accessed in noo using a ref of the following format: @[author/]name[:version] Field Description author The author of the noofile. This is optional, files with no author are maintainer by the Noo team. name The name of the noofile. version The version of the noofile. This is optional and defaults to latest . All non- latest values for this are indefinitely cached locally. Warning For package indices like NPM you might have a package like @vcokltfre/thing or thing , but you should note that in Noo the @ is required for files on indices since the @ explicitly tells the resolver to look for it on an index rather than in a local registry. For example: @vcokltfre/api-template @vcokltfre/api-template:1.0.0 @vcokltfre/api-template:latest @noo-plugin @noo-plugin:2.0.0 @noo-plugin:latest The default index for Noo is hosted at https://index.nooproject.dev/api/v1 . Types of noofile index \u00b6 Note The base URL for both static and dynamic indices must be a JSON object with the key type equal to one of static and dynamic . Noo will use thie field to determine whether it should use the downloaded file as the index (in the case of a static index), or whether to follow the API specification for a dynamic index. Static \u00b6 Static indices are a single static file served from a remote address. This is a JSON file containing a registry of remote noofile refs. Such an index may have a URL like https://my.site/noo/index.json . This file should be returned with the response header Content-Type set to application/json . Example static index content: { \"type\" : \"static\" , \"index\" : { \"vcokltfre\" : { \"api-template\" : { \"latest\" : \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcokltfre/noofiles/master/noofiles/api.noofile.yml\" , \"1.0.0\" : \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vcokltfre/noofiles/master/noofiles/api.noofile.yml\" } } } } Static indices are cached locally for a period of 24 hours. This cache can be force-updated by running noo index update [index_url] . Dynamic \u00b6 Dynamic indices are full APIs which follow the below specification for resolving noofiles.
